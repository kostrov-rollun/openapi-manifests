            It is used when the order is divided into several deals with different numbers. For example, this happens with autodist, when ordered from different warehouses, they create a separate order for each warehouse. We combine such orders into one order, with one of the order numbers in the order_number field, and the rest in the associated_order_numbers.

            Examples
              1. The time when we received a successful order creation response from the supplier API.
              2. The time when the parser finished work and successfully created an order on the site.
